# BIRTHDAY EMAIL SENDER

To run and test the code you need to:

1. Go to your email provider and make it allow less secure apps.
2. Change MY_EMAIL/MY_PASSWORD (MY_PASSWORD is the password you get when you allow a less secure app) to your own details.
3. Update the SMTP ADDRESS to match your email provider.
4. Update birthdays.csv to contain a real email, today's month and day.
